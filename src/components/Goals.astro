			<li>
				<h3>Independent</h3>
				<p>
					We will fork and maintain Nix, NixPkgs, and NixOS. Additional support
					for projects such as Nix Darwin and Home Manager will be considered.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Governance</h3>
				<p>
					A democratic model of governance with elected positions will be used to
					manage the project. A steering committee will provide direction with
					additional committees handling specific logistical tasks. Features or
					individual projects will be owned by Special Interest Groups. SIGs will
					collaborate within Working Groups to achieve their goals. Each committee
					and group will have its goals, requirements, and management process
					clearly defined.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Stabilization</h3>
				<p>
					User-friendly features such as the Nix v3 CLI will be enabled by
					default. Nix Flakes are used too heavily to remove or change and will
					instead be stabilized as a v0 in its current state with any future work
					being handled by a Special Interest Group.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Infrastructure</h3>
				<p>
					We will build and maintain the tools and infrastructure necessary to
					keep the ecosystem healthy, including Continuous Integration and Binary
					Caching.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Education</h3>
				<p>
					Unified documentation, tutorials, guides, and examples will provide a
					better onboarding experience for newcomers and a faster iteration cycle
					for experts.
				</p>
